* In this, I have tried to make a model for finding out the lanes of a road through which the car can travel, which is one of the very fundamental steps for driver-less cars.
* I have used Python Programming Language and Computer Vision here, for implementation purpose.
* Finally I have applied the designed model in a video.
</br></br>
* Here is a glimpse of the working model in image form.

* Here the BLUE LINES denote the boundary between which the vehicle is made to run 

</br></br>
* The basic intuition is to apply methods like Gaussian Blur and Canny edge detection to find the region of interest where we want the vegicle to run.
* A very basic model, that can quite nicely detect the lanes of the road and find out the vehicle's travel route.
